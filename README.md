# GAN

This project is about Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This is mini-project #5 from the class CS 444 at UIUC in Spring 2022 (https://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/spring22/assignment4.html). Read the link for more details on the project.

In this project, I implemented GAN and LSGAN (Least Squares). The top-level notebook "MP4.ipynb" contains the general flow on the training and some results.
The folder "gan" contains the models and other utility files. The training images of cats can be obtained on the project link above.
