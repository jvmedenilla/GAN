# GAN

This project is about Deep Reinforcement Learning. This is mini-project #5 from the class CS 444 at UIUC in Spring 2022 (https://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/spring22/assignment5.html). Read the link for more details on the project.

In this project, I implemented Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double DQN on the game Breakout using the OPENAI gym library (https://www.gymlibrary.dev/).
In addition, I implemented DQN with LSTM, so the model only sees current frames as observations without the need of explicit history. 

The notebook "MP5.ipynb" contains the flow of the whole process. The models and networks can be found inside the folder "gan".
